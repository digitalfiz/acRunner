USAGE:
=============================================

First extract the files into your server directory or git pull them. The go.php 
should be in the server dir with server.sh and there should be a sub directory 
called acRunner. If this is true it is setup correctly.

Next you have to modify the go.php and comment out this line:

include "mysql.php";

If is for my external login information because I am lazy and git ignore is so 
much easier then changing the password everytime I go to commit :P

Then you should see something like this:

//define('MYSQL_HOST', 'localhost');
//define('MYSQL_USERNAME', 'username');
//define('MYSQL_PASSWORD', 'password');
//define('MYSQL_DATABASE', 'database');
//define('SERVER_ID', '1');

Uncomment these lines and set them correctly. They are pretty self xplainitory. SERVER_ID
is really nothing right now it can be used in the future for multi servers. Its just forward 
thinking on my part.

Once that is done you can simply run the server like so:

$ php go.php

This is assuming you have your server setup the way you want it already.



INFORMATION ON DATABASE:
=============================================

What are these tables and how do I use them.

---------------------------------------------
current_game

	This is the realtime stats of the current game. It provides all the same information the tab 
	button does in game plus a little extra


---------------------------------------------
logs

	This is an original table that can be used to spit the raw logs too.



---------------------------------------------
options

	This table contains the current game mode and current map.
